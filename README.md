More Detailed Rephrasing:

The Door Status Detector is a simple web interface that offers real-time monitoring of a door's condition. It operates by:

Continuously Fetching Data: Every second, the application retrieves the door's status from a server.
Visual Status Indicators:
The displayed door image changes to represent an open or closed door.
The background colors of the header, footer, and status display also change, providing clear visual cues.
Dynamic Updates: The user interface automatically updates to reflect any changes in the door's status.
